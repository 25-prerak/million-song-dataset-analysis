Introduction:
We believe that to some extent, music has relationship with its origin place. This is why we started to analyze the connection between music and geography. 
This part has two focuses: 
1. The location mentioned in lyrics and reviews.
2. The location of different kind of artists.

Preparing work:
1. Collect the databases:
  Amazon Music Reviews:  With reviews of the music, we can analyse the words that comes from it. 
  MusiXmatch dataset: It has a lyric words appearance ranking Top 5000 subset.
  Artists Location Dataset: It has coordinate of the artists.
  Location Names: States names are used.
  Pop Star names: Got from Wikipedia
2. Set up dumbo or other environment to run Pig. We used pig via cloudera.
  Set up environment for R using Rstudio. Load map library and load the U.S. map.
  
The codes are mainly in two parts: 
1. Dealing database with Pig.
2. present results using RStudio.
